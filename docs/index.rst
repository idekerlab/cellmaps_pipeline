Cell Maps Pipeline for `Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) <https://cm4ai.org>`__

The Cell Maps Pipeline takes `ImmunoFluorescent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunofluorescence>`__ images from
the `Human Protein Atlas <https://www.proteinatlas.org>`__ along with
`Affinity Purification Mass Spectrometry <https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/proteomics-protein-mass-spectrometry/proteomics-protein-mass-spectrometry-workflows/protein-structure-analysis-mass-spectrometry/affinity-mass-spectrometry.html>`__
data from one or more sources, converts them into embeddings that
are then coembedded and converted into a Protein to Protein Interaction network from which a hierarchical
model is derived.

The pipeline invokes six tools that each create an output directory where results are
stored and registered within `Research Object Crates (RO-Crate) <https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate>`__ using
the `FAIRSCAPE-cli <https://pypi.org/project/fairscape-cli>`__.
